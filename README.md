# snapgame
This is a block coding game I made with Snap! back in 2018. You can tell I had just played Undertale. I never intended for this to see the light of day, but here I am posting it. Please enjoy... or don't.
In order to play this game, you'll need to visit the Snap! website at **https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#**. You shouldn't need to make an account.
**Open the .xml file** in Snap by clicking the file icon near the top left corner.
Then, click the gear and **make sure JavaScript extensions are turned on** (apparently... I honestly don't even remember why you need that).
You should be good to go. If you're not, my deepest apologies. This project is 7 years old at the time of writing, and I do not wish to acknowledge its existence further, so good luck.
